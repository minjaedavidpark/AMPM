  "transcript": "Alice: Thanks for joining the design review. I'm going to walk through the checkout flow designs for the payments launch. I have three variants and I'd like to get alignment on which one we build.\n\nAlice: First, some context. The checkout flow starts when a user clicks 'Upgrade' on any plan. They'll enter payment details and confirm. Our goals are: minimize friction, maximize conversion, and feel trustworthy.\n\nSarah: What's our baseline conversion rate from the current upgrade flow?\n\nAlice: Currently 34% of users who click upgrade complete the purchase. Industry benchmark for B2B SaaS is around 50%. So we have room to improve.\n\nAlice: Variant A is the minimal approach. Single page with payment form inline. User selects plan, enters card, clicks pay. No extra steps.\n\nDiana: From an engineering perspective, that's straightforward. Stripe Elements handles the card input, we just wrap it in our UI.\n\nBob: What about address collection? Some payment methods require billing address.\n\nAlice: Stripe collects that within their element. We don't need a separate address form.\n\nSarah: I like the simplicity. What's Variant B?\n\nAlice: Variant B adds a review step. User selects plan on page one, enters payment on page two, reviews and confirms on page three.\n\nSarah: Three steps feels like more friction.\n\nAlice: The research suggests the review step actually increases conversion. Users feel more confident when they see a summary before confirming. It reduces anxiety about making a mistake.\n\nBob: It's more engineering work - managing state across three pages - but not significantly more.\n\nSarah: What's Variant C?\n\nAlice: Variant C is a modal overlay instead of separate pages. User stays on their current page, the checkout appears as a modal. It's a more modern pattern - Notion and Linear do this.\n\nDiana: I like that from a UX perspective. The user never loses context of where they were.\n\nBob: Modals can be tricky on mobile. Is the design responsive?\n\nAlice: Yes, on mobile it becomes a full-screen takeover rather than a centered modal. I'll show you the mobile mockups.\n\nSarah: Let me see all three mobile versions.\n\nAlice: Here's Variant A mobile - straightforward vertical layout. Variant B mobile - works but three pages on mobile feels lengthy. Variant C mobile - full screen works well, the user can easily dismiss if they change their mind.\n\nSarah: I'm leaning toward Variant C. Diana, any technical concerns?\n\nDiana: The modal approach means we need to handle focus trapping for accessibility, and we need to manage the browser back button gracefully. Not insurmountable, maybe an extra day of work.\n\nAlice: For accessibility, I've designed clear focus states and escape key dismissal. We should also add a close button that's obvious.\n\nBob: What about the annual versus monthly toggle? Where does that live?\n\nAlice: Good question. In all variants, the plan selection includes a toggle between monthly and annual. Annual shows the discounted price with a 'save 20%' badge.\n\nSarah: I want to make sure the annual discount is prominent. That's good for our cash flow.\n\nAlice: I can make the annual option the default selection with the monthly as secondary. Would that be too pushy?\n\nSarah: Let's test it. Start with annual as default.\n\nBob: What about failed payments? What does the error state look like?\n\nAlice: I have error states designed. Card declined shows an inline error message below the card input with the specific reason. Network errors show a 'please try again' message with a retry button. Both keep the user's entered data so they don't have to re-enter everything.\n\nDiana: That's important. Nothing worse than having to re-enter your card number after an error.\n\nSarah: Okay, let's make a decision. I'm recommending Variant C - the modal approach. It feels more modern, keeps context, and works well on mobile. Diana, Bob, any objections?\n\nDiana: I'm supportive. The extra day of work for modal behavior is worth it.\n\nBob: Agreed. Let's do Variant C.\n\nAlice: Great. Decision made - we're going with the modal checkout, annual plan as default selection. I'll finalize the specs and hand off to Diana by tomorrow.\n\nSarah: One more thing - the success state. After payment completes, what does the user see?\n\nAlice: The modal shows a success message with confetti animation, their new plan details, and a 'Get Started' button that closes the modal. They also get a confirmation email.\n\nSarah: I love the confetti. Small delightful touch.\n\nDiana: Confetti is easy to implement. There's a library we already use.\n\nAlice: Perfect. Any other questions?\n\nBob: What about the upgrade path from within the product? Same flow?\n\nAlice: Yes, same modal appears. Whether they click upgrade in settings, on a feature gate, or from the header, they all get the same checkout experience.\n\nSarah: Consistency is good. Alright, I think we're aligned. Alice finalizes specs, Diana starts implementation, target is having checkout ready for internal testing by May 10th.\n\nDiana: That gives me a week. Tight but doable.\n\nBob: Let me know if you need help. I can pull Eric in for backend support.\n\nDiana: Thanks, I'll reach out if needed.\n\nAlice: Thanks everyone. I'll share the final Figma specs in the design channel by end of day."
