  "transcript": "Bob: Morning everyone. Let's go around. Eric, start us off.\n\nEric: Yesterday I finished the Stripe webhook handlers for payment success and failure events. Today I'm working on the refund endpoint. Blocker - I need the test Stripe API keys, the ones in the shared vault expired.\n\nBob: I'll refresh those right after standup. Carlos?\n\nCarlos: I got the staging environment set up for payments testing. Ran into an issue with the database connection pooling - we were maxing out connections during the load test. I've increased the pool size from 20 to 50 and added connection recycling.\n\nBob: Good catch. Was that causing the timeouts we saw yesterday?\n\nCarlos: Yep, exactly that. With the fix, we're now sustaining 800 transactions per minute without issues. Pushing for 1000 today.\n\nBob: Excellent. Diana?\n\nDiana: I'm working on the checkout UI. The Stripe Elements integration is mostly done. Having some CSS issues with the card input field on mobile Safari - it's not respecting our border radius.\n\nBob: Is that critical for launch?\n\nDiana: Not critical, but it looks a bit off. I'll timebox it to 2 hours today, otherwise we ship with the default styling.\n\nBob: Sounds good. Fatima?\n\nFatima: I finished the test cases for the happy path payment flow. Started on edge cases - expired cards, insufficient funds, network timeouts. Found a bug with the insufficient funds error message - it shows the raw Stripe error code instead of a user-friendly message.\n\nEric: Oh that's on me. I'll fix that today, should be quick.\n\nFatima: Also flagging a blocker - I need access to the Stripe test dashboard to trigger specific failure scenarios. Right now I can only test with the test card numbers.\n\nBob: I'll add you to the Stripe team this morning. Eric, estimated fix time for that error message?\n\nEric: Half hour tops. It's just string mapping.\n\nBob: Cool. My update - I had the Legal meeting yesterday. Good news is they've reviewed the terms and have no major concerns. They want one change to the refund policy language. I'm coordinating with Sarah on that. Expect sign-off by end of day tomorrow.\n\nCarlos: That's great news. We were worried that would slip.\n\nBob: Yeah, Sarah prepped really well for that meeting. Okay, any other blockers?\n\nDiana: Quick question - are we supporting Apple Pay at launch?\n\nBob: No, that's phase 2. Stripe's Apple Pay integration requires additional merchant verification. We're launching with card payments only.\n\nDiana: Got it. I'll remove the Apple Pay button from the UI for now.\n\nBob: Actually, hide it behind a feature flag rather than removing. We'll enable it once we have merchant verification.\n\nDiana: Will do.\n\nEric: One more thing - the subscription billing code. Mike mentioned annual billing is supposed to launch with payments. I haven't started on that yet.\n\nBob: Yeah, that's still in scope. Sarah confirmed it yesterday. Can you pick that up after the refund endpoint?\n\nEric: Sure. It's mostly Stripe configuration plus some UI for the plan selection. Probably two days of work.\n\nBob: Okay, let's prioritize refund endpoint, error message fix, then annual billing. Fatima, can you extend your test cases to cover annual billing once Eric has it ready?\n\nFatima: Already have those test cases drafted from the spec. Just need to execute once the code is ready.\n\nBob: Perfect. Alright team, we're in good shape for the May 15th launch. Biggest risk is still the load testing validation - Carlos, let's sync after this if you hit the 1000 tpm target.\n\nCarlos: Will do.\n\nBob: That's a wrap. Go ship."
