  "transcript": "Robert: We're here to finalize the Q2 roadmap. We've got big ambitions and limited resources, so we need to make hard choices. Sarah, kick us off.\n\nSarah: Thanks Robert. Based on customer feedback, sales pipeline analysis, and our strategic goals, I've identified five potential major initiatives for Q2. In priority order: payments integration, user onboarding redesign, internationalization, mobile app, and API platform.\n\nRobert: Walk us through the trade-offs.\n\nSarah: Payments is the clearest revenue unlock. David, how much pipeline is blocked on payments?\n\nDavid: Roughly $2.3 million in annual contract value. These are deals that are verbally committed but won't sign until we have payment processing.\n\nSarah: That makes payments our number one priority. Mike, what's the engineering estimate?\n\nMike: Bob's team scoped it at 6 weeks for full implementation. 3 weeks for basic Stripe integration, another 3 for enterprise features like invoicing and multi-currency.\n\nSarah: I recommend we split it. Get basic payments out in 3 weeks, iterate on enterprise features in Q3.\n\nMike: That works. We can ship Stripe integration with single currency first.\n\nRobert: Decision made. Payments MVP in 3 weeks, enterprise features pushed to Q3.\n\nSarah: Second priority - onboarding redesign. Our current sign-up to first-value time is 47 minutes. Benchmarks suggest that should be under 10 minutes.\n\nAlice: I've done competitive analysis. Best-in-class products like Notion and Figma get users to value in under 5 minutes. Our form is too long and we don't guide users enough.\n\nSarah: Alice is proposing reducing signup from 8 fields to 3, and adding an interactive product tour.\n\nBob: Engineering estimate is 2 weeks for the simplified signup, 3 weeks for the guided tour.\n\nJennifer: Marketing strongly supports this. Our activation rate is 34%. Industry benchmark is 50%. This could significantly improve our funnel.\n\nRobert: Let's do the simplified signup this quarter. How about the tour?\n\nSarah: I'd sequence the tour for early Q3. It's important but not as urgent as payments.\n\nRobert: Agreed. Decision made - simplified onboarding in Q2, guided tour in Q3.\n\nSarah: Third priority - internationalization. We've been delaying this, and EMEA customers are getting frustrated.\n\nDavid: I've lost three deals this quarter because we don't support Euros or localized content. Those were worth $400K combined.\n\nMike: I18n is a significant engineering effort. We're looking at 6 weeks minimum for the first set of languages.\n\nRobert: What languages would we target?\n\nSarah: Starting with UK English, German, and French covers 80% of our EMEA requests.\n\nRobert: Here's my thinking. We need to validate product-market fit in the US before expanding. Our retention just started improving. I want to see that trend continue before we dilute focus.\n\nSarah: That's fair. Retention is up 15% month over month since we shipped the collaboration features.\n\nRobert: Decision made - delay internationalization to Q3. Focus on US market validation first. David, manage customer expectations accordingly.\n\nDavid: Understood. I'll position it as 'coming soon' for EMEA prospects.\n\nSarah: Fourth priority - mobile app. This is a customer request we've been hearing for over a year.\n\nBob: We have two approaches. Native iOS and Android would be 4 months of work. React Native would be about 2.5 months.\n\nMike: My recommendation is React Native. Our team has strong JavaScript skills, and the technology has matured significantly.\n\nAlice: From UX perspective, React Native can deliver good experiences. Look at Instagram or Shopify.\n\nSarah: Counter-argument - our power users are on desktop. Mobile would be a 'nice to have' rather than critical for retention.\n\nRobert: What's the data say about mobile demand?\n\nDavid: 30% of prospects ask about mobile. But it's never been a deal-breaker.\n\nRobert: I'm inclined to deprioritize mobile. We should validate demand before investing heavily.\n\nSarah: How about this - we do a mobile landing page with email capture. See how much interest we get before committing engineering resources.\n\nJennifer: Marketing can run some ads to that page. Good way to gauge demand.\n\nRobert: I like it. Decision made - mobile validation campaign in Q2, actual development only if we see strong signal. Jennifer, own that campaign.\n\nJennifer: On it.\n\nSarah: Final priority - API platform. Several customers want to build integrations with our system.\n\nMike: We already have internal APIs. Making them public requires documentation, rate limiting, API keys, and developer portal.\n\nBob: Estimate is 4 weeks for a basic public API.\n\nDavid: I have one enterprise prospect specifically waiting for API access. They want to integrate with their existing tools.\n\nSarah: Here's my recommendation. Basic API access for enterprise tier only, not fully public. This lets us monetize it while limiting support burden.\n\nRobert: Who's the enterprise prospect?\n\nDavid: Meridian Financial. $800K potential ACV.\n\nRobert: That's significant. Mike, can we fast-track a limited API for that deal?\n\nMike: We can do a private beta API in 2 weeks. Limited endpoints, invited access only.\n\nSarah: That bridges the gap. We ship private beta API for Meridian and a few select customers, then evaluate broader release based on usage.\n\nRobert: Decision made. Private beta API in 2 weeks for enterprise customers. Broader API strategy revisited end of Q2.\n\nSarah: To summarize Q2 roadmap decisions: Priority 1 is payments MVP in 3 weeks. Priority 2 is simplified onboarding. Priority 3 is private beta API for enterprise. Mobile is a validation campaign only. Internationalization is deferred to Q3.\n\nRobert: One more thing - we need to discuss the free tier. It's been a growth driver but it's also costly.\n\nSarah: Good segue. Our free tier users cost us about $8 per user per month in infrastructure. At 50,000 free users, that's $400K monthly.\n\nMike: A significant portion of those users will never convert. They're using us as a free tool indefinitely.\n\nSarah: I propose reducing free tier limits. Current limit is 50 projects. I'd reduce to 10 projects for new users, grandfather existing users.\n\nJennifer: Risk of backlash on social media.\n\nSarah: We frame it positively - 'sustainable growth' messaging. And existing users aren't affected.\n\nRobert: I think this is the right call. We're not a charity. Decision made - new free tier limit is 10 projects. Sarah, coordinate messaging with Jennifer.\n\nBob: Any blockers for Q2 execution?\n\nMike: Main concern is engineering capacity. We're trying to do payments, onboarding, and API simultaneously.\n\nSarah: We'll stagger the work. Payments weeks 1-3, then team splits between onboarding and API.\n\nMike: That works. I'll need to bring in one contractor for the API work.\n\nRobert: Approved. Budget up to $50K for contractor support.\n\nMike: Thanks Robert.\n\nRobert: Great planning session everyone. Clear priorities, clear decisions. Let's execute."
