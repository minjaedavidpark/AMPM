  "transcript": "Robert: Let's get started. Sarah, can you walk us through where we are on the product roadmap?\n\nSarah: Absolutely. We're tracking well against our Q2 goals. Payments integration is on track for launch May 15th. We got Legal approval yesterday, which was our main blocker.\n\nRobert: Excellent. David, how's that going to impact sales?\n\nDavid: Huge unlock for us. We've had 23 enterprise prospects waiting specifically for payment processing. Three of them are ready to sign within a week of launch.\n\nJennifer: From marketing's side, we're planning a launch campaign around the payments feature. We'd like to position it as our move upmarket.\n\nSarah: That aligns with our strategy. The payment limits we're implementing support enterprise use cases - up to $500K per transaction.\n\nRobert: What about the internationalization question? I've been getting pressure from the board about EMEA expansion.\n\nSarah: We had that discussion in last month's planning session. The decision was to delay internationalization to Q3 to focus on US market validation first. Our retention numbers have improved 15% since that decision, so I'd recommend we stay the course.\n\nDavid: I've got EMEA customers asking weekly. What should I tell them?\n\nSarah: Tell them Q3 is our target. We're committed to localization for UK, Germany, and France as the first wave.\n\nMike: From engineering perspective, we've already scoped the i18n work. It's about 6 weeks once we start. The database schema supports it, we just need to build the translation infrastructure.\n\nRobert: Okay, let's formalize that. Q3 for EMEA, starting with UK, Germany, France. Sarah, make sure that's in the roadmap document.\n\nSarah: Will do.\n\nJennifer: On the topic of expansion - what about the pricing conversation? We've had the same pricing since launch.\n\nSarah: Good timing. We've been analyzing usage data. Our free tier is being heavily used by companies that can clearly afford to pay. My recommendation is to adjust the limits.\n\nRobert: What are you proposing?\n\nSarah: Current free tier allows 50 projects. Data shows that paying customers average 12 projects at conversion. I propose we reduce free tier to 10 projects, which still gives a great trial experience but encourages conversion earlier.\n\nDavid: Sales would love that. We're losing deals to companies who just stay on free forever.\n\nJennifer: Any risk of negative PR?\n\nSarah: We'd grandfather existing free users at their current limits. New sign-ups get the new limits. We frame it as 'sustainable pricing for long-term product investment.'\n\nRobert: Mike, any technical concerns?\n\nMike: None. The limit change is a configuration update. We can roll it out in a day.\n\nRobert: Decision made. New free tier limit is 10 projects for new users, existing users grandfathered. Sarah, coordinate with Jennifer on the messaging.\n\nSarah: Got it. We'll draft the communication this week.\n\nDavid: While we're on pricing - any thoughts on annual plans? We've had enterprise customers ask about committing for a year in exchange for a discount.\n\nSarah: We've discussed it internally. I'm proposing a 20% discount for annual commitment. That's competitive with market rates and improves our cash flow predictability.\n\nRobert: I like it. Mike, any billing system concerns?\n\nMike: Stripe supports annual billing out of the box. We'd need about a week to implement the UI changes and proration logic.\n\nRobert: Let's do it. Target it for the May 15th launch alongside payments.\n\nMike: That's tight but doable. Bob's team can prioritize it.\n\nSarah: I'll sync with Bob today.\n\nRobert: Great meeting everyone. To summarize: payments launching May 15th, new pricing limits for free tier, annual billing option launching with payments, EMEA expansion confirmed for Q3. Any blockers?\n\nDavid: I need the final pricing page mockups for the sales deck. Sarah, can we get those by Monday?\n\nSarah: Alice is working on them. I'll make sure you have them by Monday EOD.\n\nRobert: Perfect. Let's reconvene next Thursday to review launch readiness."
